# Yudiz_Task

--> For Backend Setup

1. cd .\login-registration-backend\
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Now your server should start on PORT 3000 (:

NOTE: YOU DONT NEED TO SETUP MONGODB AS I HAVE USED MONGO ATLAS CLOUD, WHICH WILL PROVIDE CLODE BASED MONGODB.

--> For Frontend Setup

4. Now open new terminal (Don't close the server terminal)
5. cd .\login-registration-frontend\
6. npm install
7. ng serve
8. in browser visit localhost:4200

It will show login screen, now you are good to go.

--> For Logical task

1. node .\logical.js 

you will see the expected result (:
